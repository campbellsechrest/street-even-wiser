## Overview

Streetwise democratizes access to professional-grade property analysis for NYC home buyers. By combining machine learning, econometric modeling, and comprehensive public data sources, we generate a standardized **Streetwise Score (0-100)** that reveals whether a listing offers good value relative to its asking price.

### 🎯 Core Value Proposition

- **For Buyers**: Close the information gap between buyers and sellers with data-driven insights
- **Transparency**: Every score is explainable with clear attribution to specific factors
- **Beyond Comparables**: Quantify nuanced factors like renovation quality, layout efficiency, and hyper-local conditions

## ✨ Key Features

### Comprehensive Scoring System
- **Overall Streetwise Score (0-100)**: Instant assessment of property value
  - 85-100: Exceptional Value
  - 70-84: Good Value  
  - 50-69: Average Value
  - 30-49: Poor Value
  - 0-29: Significantly Overpriced

### Five Category Analysis
1. **Fair Value & Market Context** (40% weight)
   - Comp-adjusted pricing analysis
   - Days on market insights
   - Price history tracking

2. **Location & Neighborhood** (20% weight)
   - Subway proximity scoring
   - School zone quality (NYC DOE data)
   - Noise level analysis
   - Neighborhood prestige ranking

3. **Building & Amenities** (15% weight)
   - Doorman/elevator availability
   - Building amenities scoring
   - Maintenance charge analysis

4. **Unit & Layout** (20% weight)
   - Renovation level classification
   - Layout efficiency analysis
   - In-unit amenities tracking

5. **Bonuses & Penalties** (±5-15% adjustment)
   - Special conditions and deal-breakers
   - Tax abatements, assessments, restrictions

### Advanced ML Features
- **Renovation Level Classifier**: 96% accuracy in detecting renovation quality from listing text
- **Hedonic Pricing Model**: Market-aware price predictions using Ridge/ElasticNet regression
- **Smart Data Extraction**: LLM-powered parsing of unstructured listing data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Every analysis includes data quality and confidence metrics
