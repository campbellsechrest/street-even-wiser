# Streetwise üè†

**AI-powered real estate valuation platform for smarter home buying decisions in NYC**

## Overview

Streetwise democratizes access to professional-grade property analysis for NYC home buyers. By combining machine learning, econometric modeling, and comprehensive public data sources, we generate a standardized **Streetwise Score (0-100)** that reveals whether a listing offers good value relative to its asking price.

### üéØ Core Value Proposition

- **For Buyers**: Close the information gap between buyers and sellers with data-driven insights
- **Transparency**: Every score is explainable with clear attribution to specific factors
- **Beyond Comparables**: Quantify nuanced factors like renovation quality, layout efficiency, and hyper-local conditions

## ‚ú® Key Features
